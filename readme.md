## Build

We recommend developing BusTub on Ubuntu 22.04, or macOS (M1/M2/Intel). We do not support any other environments (i.e., do not open issues or come to office hours to debug them). We do not support WSL. The grading environment runs
Ubuntu 22.04.

### Linux (Recommended) / macOS (Development Only)


目前所需的三方库
：faiss libdw-dev
需要手动安装

后续将三方库安装等可以类似放在下面这个packages.sh当中，

To ensure that you have the proper packages on your machine, run the following script to automatically install them:


```
# Linux
$ sudo build_support/packages.sh
# macOS
$ build_support/packages.sh
```

Then run the following commands to build the system:

```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

If you want to compile the system in debug mode, pass in the following flag to cmake:
Debug mode:

```
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ..
$ make -j`nproc`
```

If you want to use other sanitizers,

```
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DBUSTUB_SANITIZER=thread ..
$ make -j`nproc`
```

There are some differences between macOS and Linux (i.e., mutex behavior) that might cause test cases
to produce different results in different platforms. We recommend students to use a Linux VM for running
test cases and reproducing errors whenever possible.
